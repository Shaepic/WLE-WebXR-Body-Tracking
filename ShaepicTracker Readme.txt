Shaepic Color-Coded Orientation Marker (CCOM) 

PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE.

The Shaepic color-coded orientation marker (ShaepicTracker) is a 3D model and image texture combination designed to aid bone rigging for trackable avatar models.
In it's default deliverable(as include here in this repository) it is designed to represent models made in a +Z is 'Up' environment(Blender) to be tracked in a +Y is 'Up'
environment (Wonderland Engine, Unity, most game engines).

Color coded 3D orientation is a universal concept amongst most 3D design platforms with Z usually being Blue, X being red and Y being Green.

The CCOM adopts this principle and uses an addition Light-Blue for -Z, Light-Green for -Y and Orange-Yellow for -X. 

When used as an object's mesh in a joint-tracking scenario, the CCOM displays the color-coded orientation information for the specific joint it represents.
This information can then be used to orient bones appropriately for armatures in softwares such as Blender.
